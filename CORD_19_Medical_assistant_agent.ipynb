Heterozygosity of the sequenced source genome allowed discovery of more than 600,000 high quality single nucleotide variants. Despite this heterozygosity, the current genome assembly (\\u223c1.1 Gb) includes 917 Mb of sequence assigned to specific turkey chromosomes. Annotation identified nearly 16,000 genes, with 15,093 recognized as protein coding and 611 as non-coding RNA genes. Comparative analysis of the turkey, chicken, and zebra finch genomes, and comparing avian to mammalian species, supports the characteristic stability of avian genomes and identifies genes unique to the avian lineage. Clear differences are seen in number and variety of genes of the avian immune system where expansions and novel genes are less frequent than examples of gene loss. The turkey genome sequence provides resources to further understand the evolution of vertebrate genomes and genetic variation underlying economically important quantitative traits in poultry. This integrated approach may be a model for providing both gene and chromosome level assemblies of other species with agricultural, ecological, and evolutionary interest.\\\"]\",\n          \"Exhibits RIG-I binding activity and molecular function regulator. Involved in choline transport and negative regulation of RIG-I signaling pathway. Localizes to the cytosol and nucleoplasm. Colocalizes with the Golgi apparatus. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the SEC14 cytosolic factor family. It has similarity to yeast SEC14 and to Japanese flying squid RALBP which suggests a possible role of the gene product in an intracellular transport system. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene; some variants represent read-through transcripts that include exons from the upstream gene C17orf86.
